  Hi, my name's Zach and I'm an aspiring programmer and software engineer.  I have essentially become a jack-of-all-trades, so my 
  personal projects reflect that.  There are just so many different computer science topics that I just keep finding new projects to work on in many
  different fields.  I love learning, and I am willing to accept any help and ask many questions if it means I can learn better! 


  I am most passionate about: Game development, mobile app development, and other projects where I can show off my creativity.

          This project is an Android 12 mobile application that leads the user on a twelve-step timed exercise, which can run on 99% of Android devices.
          This project also contains a feature to calculate BMI that can take either imperial or metric units of measurement.
          Any completed workouts are stored in a database by the date and time completed, which the user can view to see their progress.
          
          I created this project in **Android Studio** using the **Kotlin programming language** and 
          utilized packages such as **Room**, **coroutines**, **lifecycle**, and **speech**.

          This project is an Android 12 mobile application where users can draw on a canvas, which can run on 99% of Android devices.
          I created a custom layout that contains features including a color palette, undo/redo buttons, and adjustable brush size.
          If external storage permissions are granted, users can choose to draw over their own photos and save their drawings to their devices.
          
          I created this project in **Android Studio** using the **Kotlin programming language** and 
          utilized packages such as **graphics**, **coroutines**, and **lifecycle**.

          I led an agile group of three to create a vertical platformer with custom sprites and animations, and it is playable from any computer web browser.
          This web game was developed using a custom game engine, allowing for increased developer customization.  
          We implemented a custom physics engine, level layouts, a title screen, platforms, obstacles, and a scoring system.
          
          I created this project in **VS Code** using **JavaScript** and **HTML**.

          I led an agile team of 3 to develop a trivia skills game using a model-view-controller pattern and object-oriented programming.
          We designed a fully-functioning GUI from scratch with customizable maze size and the ability to save and reload progress.
          We created a database to store and access multiple-choice trivia questions randomly to improve replayability.  
          
          I created this project in **IntelliJ** using **Java** and **SQLite**, utilizing the **JavaFX** package.

            At Vector Marketing, I set my own hours and scheduled my own appointments to sell Cutco cutlery both in-person and over the phone.
            During my time, I maintained a 95% closing ratio with in-person sales by effectively communicating and connecting with my customers.
            Due to my diligence, I earned a Presidentâ€™s Letter by selling over $10,000 of Cutco products over three months.
